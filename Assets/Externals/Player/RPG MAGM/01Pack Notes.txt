Thank you for purchasing!


There are 3 folders of sprite sheets:
8 direction folder
RPG MAKER folder  (RPG MAKER MV or MZ)
sprites folder (any engine)


RPG MAKER Instructions:
To get the most of these battlers you should set the SV attack images in your MV system to "none."
this will disable any default weapon images from showing up during attack motions.

There is a layered file provided with the largest resolution of the sheets for those who would like to try resize to higher resolutions.


Helpful tips:
the "escape motion" on the battlers sheet can also be use as a forward dash motion if you
are designing elaborate movement during combat. This is easily achived with Yanfly's action sequence plugins.
